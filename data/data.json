    "about": "<p>My name is Cyril Kalikin and I enjoy designing and developing web applications to solve challenging problems and learning new frameworks and software. I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in May 2016 with a Bachelors Degree in Information Sciences and Technology.  While providing consulting and website development as part of a group for St Francis Home, I improved my customer service skills and programming skills. </p> <p> A few months later I did my internship at Everglades Technologies. During this internship I was a web developer with the company and developed two web applications. Throughout the internship I worked successfully with a wide range of clients between those with knowledge of application development to those without an IT background. After my internship with Everglades Technologies ended I was brought back as an independent developer while attending college as a full time student. I am currently employed at Knowledgent as a web developer in the IT department.</p> <p> I am seeking employment so that I can continue to develop my skills in a web development related field. During my time as an intern, consultant and a web developer I felt most satisfied when a web application was successfully designed and developed to solve a client's problems. My goal is to seek further employment as a web developer or UX developer as I feel my determination, knowledge and skills would be an asset to a job in this area.</p>",
